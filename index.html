                    <h3>WordPress</h3>
                    <p>I began my Web Development career on WordPress hosting blogs and ecommerce stores. I have worked on the platfrom for more than 5 years and have an incredibel appreciation and understanding for it. It's a powerful tool when leveraged correctly.</p>

                    <h3>Swift Developmen</h3>
                    <p>Wed Development led me to Swift, Apple's Proprietary Coding Language. I wanted to develop apps and games on mobile and I believe in Apple's ecosystem for developing and deploying apps, so it felt right to learn swift. My career has led me in different directions, both as a teacher of Swift with Apple as well as a Developer on the platform. I have 4 years of experience in Swift and began my journey on Swift 4.0 in September 2017</p>

                    <h3>Full Stack Development</h3>
                    <p>Currently I am expanding my interests and area of expertise into Full Stack Development with MERN through MiT's Adult Learning Facility. I am currently Learning the MERN technology stack, a popular JavaScript stack used for a smooth, ultra-efficient development process. MERN consists of four different open-source components: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. These components provide the end-to-end framework support for developers.</p>

                    <p>My love for development and the Web has opened up an incredible pool or knowledge and opportunity. Despite development being my line of work, my passion for hardware and networking has seeped into my personal life. I have severla self hosted webiste, services and applications that I run from my home network. From Windows Deployment Servers where I write and implement my own windows images to Home Automation and self hosted cloud services.</p>

                <p>I am a deep rooted techie with a passion for hardware and development. I built my first app when I was 16 and have fallen in love with development ever since</p>
                <p>I currently teach Swift Creative Pro for Coding and Gaming through Apple's Today at Apple program. Swift is an incredbly safe language to learn on, my classes range from children as young as 4 to young developers and adults alike.</p>
                <p>I am always seeking ways to improve my skillset, with my most recent acceptance into a Full Stack Development course through MiT. I hope to gain accreditation as a Full Stack developer and persue a career in development. I am always eager to learn and improve my skills as I grow in my career as a developer</p>
